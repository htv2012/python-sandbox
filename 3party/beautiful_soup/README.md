# Introduction

This directory/project is my sandbox to play with beautiful soup.

# Setup

I created this project by issuing the following commands at the terminal:

    cd ~/src/python
    mkproject beautiful_soup
    pip install beautifulsoup4
    
The previous commands make up the one-time setup. Now, every time I want to work on this project, I will issue the following command:

    workon beautiful_soup
    
Once done working, I can issue the following command to exit my sandbox environment:

    deactivate
