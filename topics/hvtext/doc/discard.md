# Discard Text Lines

When processing text lines, we often need to discard certain lines
such as blank lines, or comments. The `discard` submodule provides this
functionality.

## Samples

* *csv_with_comment.py* demonstrates the use of `discard.blank()` and
  `discard.comment()` to parse a CSV file
* *parse_json_with_comments.py* demonstrates parsing JSON file with
  comments
